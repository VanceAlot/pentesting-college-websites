# pentesing-college-websites
Pentesting college websites.
Submit your college's website by opening an issue with whatever info you want to give (minimum is URL).
Includes bash and shell scripts for info retreival.
<br />
## Info can include - 
- Any domains/directories/subdomains you know of
- Any pdf/file/image/video (any multiMedia basically) hosted on the site
- Any misc. info that you might have
- Creds
  - ###### Regarding Creds <br />
    - If your info includes sensitive info (for eg. creds) you can mail it at *pencolweb@gmail.com* <br />
    - You can mail using a temp mail (https://temp-mail.org/) if you want to stay anonymous. <br />
    - Stay assured that your creds won't ever be disclosed anywhere or to anyone. <br />
    - If a requirement to use your creds arrives, your permission will be taken first and the process would be proceeded only when it is made clear to you on how your creds will be used and everything associated with it.

## checklist (will be built as I progress)
- Info gathering
  - nmap
    - server ip
    - dns records
    
- identify the attack surface
  - directory enum
  - subdomain enum
  
- run virtual hosts to get a [reverseDNS]('https://pentest-tools.com/information-gathering/find-virtual-hosts') output

- run a tcp port scanner and you might as well find some unfiltered ssh service running or maybe some other vuln service, refer to google dorking to find vulns from here
[TCP Port Scanner]('https://pentest-tools.com/network-vulnerability-scanning/tcp-port-scanner-online-nmap')

- [OPTIONAL] Run a UDP scan for the same -> https://pentest-tools.com/network-vulnerability-scanning/udp-port-scanner-online-nmap

- Check for common vulnerabilities
  - SQL Injection
  - XSS
  - OS command Injection
  - Directory Listing
  - outdated server software
  - mismanaged server config files
  - other sensitive files that may be available through other openings on the server

### Bypass 403 forbidden
- on important config file like .htaccess
- TRY HTTP Smuggling --> POST --> TRACE --> GET
- TRY content-length: 0;
- Execution through UI element insertion (dropdown li's) 

### Try Authenticated then
- get some kind of auth for the site 
- check the same
- but now there is a gurantee that you will have atleast some input fields, so check on them

### based on netwokr requests
- keep burpsuite in forward mode open
- try with postman
- and keep the chrome network tab open whenever there is a dynamic action being perfomed or some cred related thing happening (login etc.)


TODO - BUILD AUTOMATION TOOL WITH THE BUILT CHECKLIST
- build something like this but specialised for college websites.
('https://pentest-tools.com/features/pentest-robots')
- will follow a wiggle wifi like model, you can scan but the info will be enumed to a db (this repo)

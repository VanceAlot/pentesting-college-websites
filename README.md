# pentesing-college-websites
Pentesting college websites.
Submit your college's website by opening an issue with whatever info you want to give (minimum is URL).
Includes bash and shell scripts for info retreival.
<br />
## Info can include - 
- Any domains/directories/subdomains you know of
- Any pdf/file/image/video (any multiMedia basically) hosted on the site
- Any misc. info that you might have
- Creds
  - ###### Regarding Creds <br />
    - If your info includes sensitive info (for eg. creds) you can mail it at *pencolweb@gmail.com* <br />
    - You can mail using a temp mail (https://temp-mail.org/) if you want to stay anonymous. <br />
    - Stay assured that your creds won't ever be disclosed anywhere or to anyone. <br />
    - If a requirement to use your creds arrives, your permission will be taken first and the process would be proceeded only when it is made clear to you on how your creds will be used and everything associated with it.
